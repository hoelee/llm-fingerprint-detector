**Is that API really serving the model it claims?** Fingerprint and verify any OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint from single-token output distributions — no logits, no weights, no privileged access. Just ~100–400 cheap one-word completions. Catches **model substitution**, silent quantization and server-side prompt injection by API resellers, gateways and aggregators.

An independent, open-source TypeScript implementation of:

This package is **not affiliated with the paper's author** — it is a from-scratch implementation of the published method, engineered as a reusable library + CLI. If you use the method in research, cite the paper.

- **Zero runtime dependencies** — Node ≥ 18 built-in `fetch`, nothing else
- **Library + CLI** — embed it, or run `llm-fingerprint verify` in CI
- **Reasoning-model aware** — auto-detects how to disable hidden "thinking" (OpenRouter / Zhipu / OpenAI-style), with a graceful fallback
- **Filter-resistant probes** — every probe is a plain semantic question drawn from a paraphrase pool; there is no magic string a gateway can special-case
- **Bundled sample references** for 11 popular models, derived from the paper's public dataset

## How it works

LLMs answer "*Name a random number between 1 and 100*" with model-specific, surprisingly stable biases (GPT-family models love 42 and 73; other families prefer 57, 37, 7…). The paper's key result: the **empirical distribution of one-word answers** across a small battery of such tasks is a reliable *behavioral fingerprint* — stable across time, load and providers for the same model, and clearly different between models.

```
 probe battery (task × language cells)      collect at temperature 1.0
 ┌──────────────────────────────┐           ┌─────────────────────────┐
 │ random number 1-100 (en/zh)  │           │ "42" ×19  "73" ×4  ...  │
 │ random color / letter / city │  ──25×──▶ │ per-cell answer         │
 │ coin flip / animal / fav-num │           │ distributions           │
 └──────────────────────────────┘           └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                                        ▼
                reference fingerprint  ──── mean per-cell Jensen-Shannon
                (trusted endpoint)          divergence (base 2) ──▶ verdict
```

1. **Probe** — ask one-word questions (random numbers, colors, letters, coin flips…) in English and Chinese, `temperature=1.0`, `max_tokens=16`, a fixed minimal system prompt, hidden reasoning disabled. Requests are shuffled and paraphrased per call.
2. **Normalize** — NFC, punctuation/emoji stripping, case folding, first word, digit unification (`seven`/`七`/`٧`/`７` → `7`), color and coin-word canonicalization; answers are classified valid / invalid / refusal / empty.
3. **Compare** — per-cell Jensen-Shannon divergence (base 2, range 0–1 bit), averaged over cells where both sides have ≥10 valid samples.
4. **Verdict** — three bands calibrated against the paper's baselines (see [Interpreting results](#interpreting-results)).

## Install

```bash
npm install llm-fingerprint-detector    # library + `llm-fingerprint` CLI
# or run the CLI ad hoc:
npx llm-fingerprint-detector --help
```

Requires Node ≥ 18.17 (built-in `fetch`). The core library is runtime-agnostic and also works in browsers/edge runtimes; only the CLI and the bundled-reference loader touch the filesystem.

## Quick start — CLI

```bash
# 1. Fingerprint the endpoint you trust (key read from OPENAI_API_KEY)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
llm-fingerprint fingerprint \
  --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --out reference.gpt-4o-mini.json

# 2. Verify the endpoint you don't
export LLM_FINGERPRINT_API_KEY=sk-...   # key for the endpoint under test
llm-fingerprint verify \
  --base-url https://cheap-llm-reseller.example.com/v1 \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --reference reference.gpt-4o-mini.json
```

```
Verdict: MISMATCH — behavior differs from the reference
Mean JSD: 0.481 over 8 comparable cell(s)

Interpretation scale (paper baselines, arXiv:2607.10252):
  same model ≈ 0.14 · same model, other provider ≈ 0.227 · different model ≈ 0.463
  thresholds: match ≤ 0.25 < uncertain ≤ 0.35 < mismatch

Per-cell JSD (most divergent first):
  random-number-1-100:en     0.712  (24 vs 25 valid)
  ...
```

Exit codes are CI-friendly: `0` match · `2` mismatch · `3` uncertain · `4` insufficient · `1` error. API keys are only ever read from environment variables (`--api-key-env NAME`, defaulting to `LLM_FINGERPRINT_API_KEY` then `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and are never logged.

More: `llm-fingerprint --help`, [`examples/cli-examples.sh`](examples/cli-examples.sh).

## Quick start — library

```ts
import { fingerprint, compare, verify } from 'llm-fingerprint-detector'

// Collect a fingerprint
const run = await fingerprint(
  { baseUrl: 'https://api.openai.com/v1', model: 'gpt-4o-mini', apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY },
  { cells: 8, samplesPerCell: 25, onProgress: (e) => console.log(e.done, '/', e.total) },
)
console.log(run.fingerprint)          // JSON-serializable artifact
console.log(run.splitHalfJsd)         // self-consistency (≈0.14 is normal)

// Verify another endpoint against it
const result = await verify(
  { baseUrl: 'https://suspect.example.com/v1', model: 'gpt-4o-mini', apiKey: process.env.SUSPECT_KEY },
  run.fingerprint,
)
console.log(result.verdict, result.meanJsd)   // 'match' | 'uncertain' | 'mismatch' | 'insufficient'

// Or compare two saved fingerprints offline
const distance = compare(fingerprintA, fingerprintB)
```

Bundled sample references (Node only):

```ts
import { listBundledReferences, loadBundledReference } from 'llm-fingerprint-detector/references'

const reference = loadBundledReference('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
const result = await verify(suspectEndpoint, reference)
```

## Tutorial: "Is my cheap API really GPT-4o / Claude / DeepSeek?"

You bought API access from a reseller/aggregator at half price. Are you getting the real model, a cheaper substitute, or a quantized clone? Ten minutes:

1. **Collect a trusted reference.** Fingerprint the *official* API (or any endpoint you fully trust) for the model in question:

   ```bash
   llm-fingerprint fingerprint --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 \
     --model gpt-4o-mini --api-key-env OFFICIAL_KEY --out ref.json
   ```

   No official access? Start with a bundled sample (`llm-fingerprint references`) — good enough for a first signal, with the caveats below.

2. **Verify the suspect endpoint** with the *same* model id:

   ```bash
   llm-fingerprint verify --base-url https://reseller.example.com/v1 \
     --model gpt-4o-mini --api-key-env RESELLER_KEY --reference ref.json
   ```

3. **Read the verdict.**
   - `match` — the endpoint's one-token behavior is statistically consistent with your reference. That is strong (not absolute) evidence it's the same model.
   - `mismatch` — the behavior is as far from the reference as *different* models typically are. Common causes, in practice: a substituted cheaper model, a heavily quantized deployment, or an injected system prompt.
   - `uncertain` — the gray zone. Raise `--samples` (e.g. 40), use `--preset strict` (all 16 cells), or refresh your reference — models drift when providers ship updates.
   - Also watch the warnings: a high **split-half JSD** means the endpoint disagrees *with itself* between the first and second half of your own run — a classic sign of an aggregator rotating several backends.

4. **Re-run before you conclude anything.** Two independent mismatch runs on different days are a much stronger signal than one.

## Interpreting results

Distances are mean Jensen-Shannon divergence (base 2), so 0 = identical behavior, 1 = disjoint answer sets. Paper baselines:

| meanJsd | reading |
|---|---|
| ≈ 0.14 | same model, same endpoint (sampling noise floor) |
| ≈ 0.227 | same model, different provider (median) |
| **≤ 0.25** | → verdict **match** |
| 0.25 – 0.35 | → verdict **uncertain** |
| **> 0.35** | → verdict **mismatch** |
| ≈ 0.463 | different models (median) |

**Error rates (paper):** distinguishing same-model vs different-model pairs achieves an equal error rate of ≈ **10.6% with 8 cells** and ≈ **7.3% with 40 cells**. A single run is *evidence*, not proof — treat verdicts accordingly.

### Limitations you must know

- **Fingerprints drift.** Providers silently update models; a 3-month-old reference can legitimately mismatch today's deployment. Always check `collectedAt`, refresh references regularly.
- **You need a trusted reference.** The method compares two endpoints; it cannot conjure ground truth. If your reference is wrong, your verdict is wrong.
- **The system prompt must be identical on both sides.** Swapping only the system prompt shifts fingerprints by JSD ≈ 0.44–0.46 — the magnitude of a model swap. This tool pins the same minimal system prompt on both sides automatically; if an endpoint *injects* its own server-side prompt, that will (correctly) surface as divergence.
- **Reasoning fallback lowers confidence.** When hidden reasoning can't be disabled, the run is flagged `postReasoning` — distributions shift measurably in that channel.
- **Quantization/serving stack changes** the same weights can move distances into the uncertain band.
- **A mismatch is a statistical observation, not an accusation.** Do not treat any single verdict as proof of fraud by a provider; investigate, re-run, and compare notes before drawing conclusions.

## Bundled sample references

`data/reference-fingerprints.sample.json` ships fingerprints of 11 popular models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek-chat, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-30B-A3B, Mistral Small 3.2, GLM-4.5, Kimi K2), derived from the paper's public dataset:

> Bruckner, T. (2026). *Single-token output distributions as behavioral fingerprints of large language models* [Data set]. Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21278557](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21278557) — CC-BY-4.0. Counts reconstructed from the published per-cell distributions and re-normalized with this package's normalizer (see [`scripts/build-sample-references.mjs`](scripts/build-sample-references.mjs)).

Those samples were collected by the paper's harness (via OpenRouter) under the paper's prompt protocol — close to, but not identical to, this package's battery. `compare()` flags such pairs with `protocolMismatch: true` and the verdict should be read as *indicative*. For anything that matters, collect your own reference:

```bash
llm-fingerprint fingerprint --base-url <trusted-url> --model <id> --out my-reference.json
```

To rebuild or extend the bundled samples from the Zenodo dataset, download the dataset, then:

```bash
npm run build
node scripts/build-sample-references.mjs path/to/distributions.json --models openai/gpt-4o,another/model
```

## API surface (TypeScript, fully typed)

| export | what it does |
|---|---|
| `fingerprint(endpoint, options?)` | probe an endpoint → `FingerprintRun` (fingerprint, adapter, split-half, warnings) |
| `compare(a, b)` | two fingerprints → `ComparisonResult` (meanJsd, per-cell JSD, verdict, baselines) |
| `verify(endpoint, reference, options?)` | fingerprint + compare in one call → `VerifyResult` |
| `normalizeAnswer(raw, domain)` | the full normalization pipeline (pure, unit-tested) |
| `jensenShannonDivergence(p, q)` | base-2 JSD over count maps |
| `splitHalfJsd(samplesByCell)` | endpoint self-consistency check |
| `detectReasoningAdapter(endpoint)` | which reasoning-disable field the endpoint accepts |
| `PROBE_TASKS`, `CELL_PRIORITY_ORDER`, `SYSTEM_PROMPTS` | the battery itself |
| `llm-fingerprint-detector/references` | bundled sample loader (Node only) |

All options (`cells`, `samplesPerCell`, `concurrency`, `timeoutMs`, `maxRetries`, `signal`, `onProgress`, …) are documented in [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build     # tsc → dist/
npm test          # builds, then runs node --test against the built output
```

No test framework, no bundler — TypeScript and the Node built-in test runner only.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Especially valuable:

- **More languages** in the probe battery (the paper also used Arabic and Russian) — requires matching normalizer support, see `src/normalizer.ts`
- **Reference fingerprints** for more models/providers, collected with this tool's protocol (`one-token/v1`) and a documented date/channel
- **Threshold calibration data**: pairs of same-model / different-model runs to sharpen the match/mismatch cut points

Please keep changes dependency-free and covered by `node --test` tests.
